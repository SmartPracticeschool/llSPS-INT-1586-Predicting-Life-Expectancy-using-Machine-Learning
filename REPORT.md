## Predicting life expectancy using machine learning
 
### Project Summary :
In this project created a new model based on the data provided is to evaluate the life expectancy in India.

The data offers a timeframe from 2015 to 2022. The output algorithms have been used to test if they can maintain their accuracy in predicting the life expectancy for data they haven't been trained. Five algorithms have been used:

##### 1. Linear Regression
##### 2. Polynomial Regression
##### 3. Logistic Regression
##### 4. Ridge Regression
##### 5. Lasso Regression
